I'm learning about the Github thread and branch strategy. 
Here's a good video to familiarize yourself with: Getting started with branching workflows, Git Flow and GitHub Flow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW6dFpTMk8s

Also a good article on the same topic: Git-Flow vs GitHub-Flow by Quang Nguyen https://quangnguyennd.medium.com/git-flow-vs-github-flow-620c922b2cbd

Installation of the Terraform (for Windows): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/get-started-windows-bash?tabs=bash

Also, good video from Cloud Guru, about the installation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljYzclmsvF4

Ð¡hecking whether the terraform is installed.
